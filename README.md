# 🔄 Push Swap

> *"Sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions."*

A sorting algorithm project from [42 School](https://42.fr) — sort a stack of integers using two stacks and a restricted set of operations, with the **minimum number of moves possible**.

## 📚 About

**Push Swap** challenges you to implement an efficient sorting algorithm under strict constraints. You are given:

- **Stack A** — initially containing a random list of integers
- **Stack B** — initially empty

Your goal: sort stack A in **ascending order** using only the allowed operations, in as few moves as possible.

## 🕹️ Allowed Operations

| Operation | Description |
|---|---|
| `sa` | Swap the first two elements of stack A |
| `sb` | Swap the first two elements of stack B |
| `ss` | `sa` and `sb` simultaneously |
| `pa` | Push the top element of B onto A |
| `pb` | Push the top element of A onto B |
| `ra` | Rotate A upward (first element becomes last) |
| `rb` | Rotate B upward (first element becomes last) |
| `rr` | `ra` and `rb` simultaneously |
| `rra` | Reverse rotate A (last element becomes first) |
| `rrb` | Reverse rotate B (last element becomes first) |
| `rrr` | `rra` and `rrb` simultaneously |

## 🚀 Usage

### Compilation

```bash
make
```

### Run

```bash
./push_swap [list of integers]
```

### Examples

```bash
# Simple sort
./push_swap 3 1 2
# pb
# ra
# pa

# Random list
./push_swap 42 -7 0 15 -3

# Check number of operations
./push_swap 5 2 4 1 3 | wc -l

# Verify correctness with checker (bonus)
./push_swap 5 2 4 1 3 | ./checker 5 2 4 1 3
```

⚙️ Algorithm

Small stacks (≤ 5 elements)


2 elements — one sa if needed
3 elements — hardcoded decision tree (at most 2 operations)
5 elements — push 2 elements to B, sort 3 in A, then reinsert from B


Large stacks (> 5 elements) — Radix Sort

The main algorithm used is a binary Radix Sort, adapted to work with the two-stack constraint.

Principle

Instead of sorting by value directly, each element is first replaced by its index (rank compression), so values range from 0 to n-1. Sorting is then done bit by bit, from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB).

Steps

Index compression — replace each value with its sorted rank (0 to n-1)
For each bit position (from LSB to MSB):

Iterate over all elements in A
If the current bit of the element is 0 → pb (push to B)
If the current bit is 1 → ra (rotate, keep in A)
Once all elements are processed → pa all elements back from B to A


After log2(n) passes, stack A is fully sorted


Example (simplified)

Initial (indexed): A = [2, 0, 3, 1]  B = []

Pass 1 (bit 0):
  2 (10) → bit 0 = 0 → pb
  0 (00) → bit 0 = 0 → pb
  3 (11) → bit 0 = 1 → ra
  1 (01) → bit 0 = 1 → ra
  → pa, pa
  A = [0, 2, 1, 3]

Pass 2 (bit 1):
  0 (00) → bit 1 = 0 → pb
  2 (10) → bit 1 = 1 → ra
  1 (01) → bit 1 = 0 → pb
  3 (11) → bit 1 = 1 → ra
  → pa, pa
  A = [0, 1, 2, 3] ✅

Why Radix?


Simple and predictable: O(n × log2(n)) operations
No complex cost calculation
Consistent performance regardless of input order


## 📊 Performance

Expected operation counts (typical benchmarks):

| Stack size | Max operations | Target |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | 3 | ≤ 3 |
| 5 | 12 | ≤ 12 |
| 100 | 700 | ≤ 700 |
| 500 | 5000 | ≤ 5500 |

> Grade at 42 depends on staying under the operation thresholds for 100 and 500 elements.

## 🛡️ Error Handling

The program writes `Error\n` to `stderr` and exits in the following cases:

- Non-integer argument
- Integer overflow (outside `INT_MIN` / `INT_MAX`)
- Duplicate values
- No arguments → no output (already sorted)

```bash
./push_swap 1 2 abc
# Error

./push_swap 1 2 2
# Error

./push_swap 2147483648
# Error
```

---

## ✅ Testing

```bash
# Generate random input and count operations
ARG=$(shuf -i 1-500 -n 100 | tr '\n' ' ') ; ./push_swap $ARG | wc -l

# Verify correctness
ARG="3 1 2 5 4" ; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG

```
